# Overview

So, for my final module, i wrote a collection of solutions to small and simple problems within "Cracking the Coding interview"

And when I decided that wasn't quite enough, I recalled a project I thought about ages ago. A program to convert an image and display it in ascii characters

# Development Environment

I am using visual studio paired with python to acomplish this, and I am using the pillow library to manage the images

# Useful Websites

{Make a list of websites that you found helpful in this project}
* [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/)
(I am totally buying one of these)

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}
* My current system only captures a single pixel for each of its symbols, but I want to find a way to get the average of a certain range of pixels and convert that for a more accurate picture. 
* Also, I would love to spend more time reading this book.
